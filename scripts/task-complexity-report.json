      "taskTitle": "Database Schema Design & Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the database schema design and implementation task into subtasks covering requirements analysis, normalization, ERD creation, schema definition, migration scripting, ORM/model implementation, indexing strategy, seed data creation, and comprehensive testing (unit, integration, and performance).",
      "reasoning": "This task involves designing a complex relational schema with multiple interrelated entities, enforcing constraints, creating migrations, implementing models, and ensuring TDD coverage. The breadth of entities, normalization, and need for robust testing and performance optimization make it highly complex and suitable for further decomposition beyond the current subtasks."

      "taskTitle": "Data Collection and Seeding Mechanism",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the data collection and seeding mechanism into subtasks for template/schema design, data sourcing and research, data validation tooling, seeding script development, update/refresh process automation, error logging/reporting, and documentation.",
      "reasoning": "This task requires designing data templates, collecting and validating real-world academic data, building robust seeding and update scripts, and ensuring repeatability and error handling. The need for both technical and manual processes, plus future-proofing for updates, increases its complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Core API Development with TDD",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the core API development into subtasks for project scaffolding, endpoint-by-endpoint TDD cycles (including tests, implementation, and documentation), middleware setup, error handling, validation, integration with database models, API documentation, and CI integration.",
      "reasoning": "Developing a RESTful API with strict TDD, covering multiple resource types, filtering, recommendations, and robust error handling, is a large and intricate effort. Each endpoint and cross-cutting concern (validation, error handling, documentation) warrants its own subtask for clarity and maintainability."

      "taskTitle": "User Onboarding and Data Input Flows",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the onboarding and data input flows into subtasks for each major UI component (landing, questionnaire, Bagrut form, psychometric input, consent), state management, API integration, validation, accessibility, and responsive design.",
      "reasoning": "This task covers multiple interactive frontend flows, each with validation, state management, and API integration. Ensuring accessibility, responsiveness, and a seamless user experience across all steps adds to the complexity, justifying further breakdown."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down program discovery and filtering into subtasks for backend API enhancements, frontend list and filter UI, state management, navigation/routing, responsive design, and integration testing.",
      "reasoning": "This task spans both backend and frontend, requiring efficient filtering logic, UI/UX design, state management, and seamless integration. The need for responsive, accessible, and performant components across the stack increases its complexity."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the matching algorithm task into subtasks for requirements analysis, data model design, rule definition, core matching logic, confidence scoring, service orchestration, API integration, and algorithm extensibility planning.",
      "reasoning": "Designing a rule-based matching system that integrates academic data, preferences, and produces confidence-ranked recommendations is algorithmically and architecturally complex. Ensuring modularity for future enhancements and robust testing further increases the need for detailed subtasks."

      "taskId": 7,
      "taskTitle": "Program Detail Page Implementation",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose the program detail page into subtasks for layout/core info, admission requirements, external links, user-specific insights, community integration, responsive design, and accessibility testing.",
      "reasoning": "While focused on a single page, this task involves integrating diverse data, conditional logic for user-specific insights, external links, and community features, all with a high bar for UX and accessibility."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Expand the comparison tool into subtasks for state management, selection UI, comparison view layout, attribute extraction/highlighting, user-specific match integration, navigation, and responsive/accessibility testing.",
      "reasoning": "Building a dynamic, interactive comparison tool with state persistence, difference highlighting, and user-specific logic is moderately complex, especially when ensuring usability and accessibility across devices."

      "taskTitle": "Backend Deployment and CI/CD Pipeline",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down backend deployment and CI/CD into subtasks for CI setup, infrastructure provisioning, deployment automation, environment configuration, database migration integration, monitoring/logging, alerting, and rollback procedures.",
      "reasoning": "Setting up a robust CI/CD pipeline with automated testing, secure deployments, infrastructure as code, monitoring, and rollback is a multifaceted DevOps challenge requiring careful planning and execution."
