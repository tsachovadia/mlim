<!-- Current focus and immediate working context -->

## ðŸŽ¯ CURRENT FOCUS

**Active Mode:** VAN (Initialization)
**Current Phase:** Task Structure Analysis Complete
**Next Action:** Ready for PLAN Mode transition

## ðŸ“Œ IMMEDIATE CONTEXT

### Platform Information
- **OS:** macOS (darwin 24.3.0)
- **Shell:** /bin/zsh
- **Workspace:** /Users/thesyrianhammock/Documents/1 Projects/mlim

### Memory Bank Status
- âœ… Memory Bank directory created
- âœ… Core files initialized
- âœ… Task structure discovered and analyzed
- âœ… Complexity assessment: LEVEL 4 (Complex System)
- ðŸ”„ Ready for PLAN Mode

## ðŸ”„ ACTIVE DECISIONS

1. **Memory Bank Structure:** Standard isolation-focused structure implemented
2. **Project Type:** Academic Program Matching Platform for Israeli Universities
3. **Complexity Level:** LEVEL 4 (Complex System) - 10 main tasks, 49 subtasks
4. **Mode Transition:** VAN â†’ PLAN Mode (Level 4 workflow)

## ðŸ’­ WORKING MEMORY

### Recent Actions
- Created memory-bank directory
- Initialized core Memory Bank files
- Set up task tracking system

### Pending Actions
- Receive task description
- Perform complexity assessment
- Determine appropriate mode transition

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL NOTES

- Memory Bank is now the single source of truth
- All task tracking must go through tasks.md
- Mode transitions based on complexity level
