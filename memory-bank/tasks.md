## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS

### Database Architecture
**Pattern:** Normalized relational model with proper foreign key constraints
**Key Tables:** institutions ‚Üí faculties ‚Üí programs ‚Üí admission_requirements, users ‚Üí user_grades/scores/preferences
**Performance Strategy:** Strategic indexing on frequently queried fields (institution_id, faculty_id, program_id, user_id, field_of_study)
**Migration Strategy:** Version-controlled database migrations with up/down scripts

### API Architecture  
**Pattern:** RESTful API with clear resource-based endpoints
**Core Endpoints:**
- `/api/v1/institutions` - Institution management
- `/api/v1/programs` - Program discovery and filtering
- `/api/v1/users/academic-profile` - User data management
- `/api/v1/recommendations/programs` - Matching algorithm

**Middleware Stack:** Request validation ‚Üí Authentication ‚Üí Error handling ‚Üí Logging
**Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI for all endpoints

### Frontend Architecture
**Pattern:** Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
**Component Hierarchy:** Pages ‚Üí Layout ‚Üí Feature Components ‚Üí UI Components
**State Management:** Redux for global state, local state for component-specific data
**Routing:** React Router for SPA navigation
**Form Management:** Formik or React Hook Form with Yup validation

### Matching Algorithm Architecture
**Pattern:** Hybrid approach - Weighted Linear Scoring with Decision Tree gates
**Core Components:**
- UserProfile data model
- ProgramRequirements data model  
- Weighted scoring engine (35% psychometric, 30% bagrut, 25% subjects, 10% preferences)
- Hard requirements gating
- Confidence level calculator ("High Chance" 85-100, "Good Fit" 70-84, "Potential Match" 50-69)

## üé® CREATIVE PHASE DECISIONS SUMMARY

### 1. Style Guide Created
**Location:** `memory-bank/style-guide.md`
**Key Elements:**
- Primary Blue (#2563EB) for trust and academic excellence
- Success/Warning/Info colors for match confidence levels
- Inter font family with clear type scale
- Tailwind CSS utility classes for consistency
- Component styles for buttons, cards, forms, and indicators

### 2. Landing Page & Onboarding Design
**Decision:** Progressive Disclosure Wizard
**Rationale:** Best mobile experience, highest completion rates, proven pattern
**Key Features:**
- Step-by-step wizard flow
- Progress persistence in localStorage
- Mobile-optimized with touch-friendly inputs
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant

### 3. Program Discovery Interface
**Decision:** Uniform Grid with Hover Details
**Rationale:** Best balance of visual appeal and information density
**Key Features:**
- Fixed-height cards in responsive grid
- Hover/tap to reveal additional details
- Sidebar filters (desktop) / Bottom sheet (mobile)
- Virtual scrolling for performance

### 4. Matching Algorithm
**Decision:** Weighted Linear Scoring + Decision Tree Hybrid
**Rationale:** Simple to implement, fast performance, explainable results
**Key Features:**
- Weighted scoring: 35% psychometric, 30% bagrut, 25% subjects, 10% preferences
- Hard requirements gate for minimum thresholds
- Graceful handling of incomplete data
- Extensible for future ML enhancements
