3. **REFACTOR Phase:** Enhanced code quality with utilities and patterns

**Users API Features:**
- Complete CRUD operations for user management
- Email validation and duplicate prevention
- Security constraints (email modification protection)
- Academic profile integration
- Program matches display
- Comprehensive error handling
- Hebrew/English bilingual support

### TDD Implementation Success üèÜ
- **43 total tests passing** across all implemented APIs
- **100% endpoint coverage** for completed features
- **Strict TDD methodology** followed throughout
- **Frequent commits** after each RED-GREEN-REFACTOR phase
- **High code quality** with comprehensive refactoring

### Technical Achievements üîß

- **Type-safe TypeScript** implementation throughout
- **Standardized response patterns** across all endpoints
- **Utility libraries** for validation, query building, and helpers
- **Real Israeli data** for authentic testing scenarios

## üéØ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### Current Sprint: Academic Profiles API
**Following TDD Methodology:**
1. **RED Phase:** Write failing tests for academic profile CRUD operations
2. **GREEN Phase:** Implement minimal API to pass tests
3. **REFACTOR Phase:** Enhance code quality and patterns

**Endpoints to Implement:**
- `GET /api/v1/academic-profiles/:userId` - Get user's academic profile
- `POST /api/v1/academic-profiles` - Create academic profile
- `PUT /api/v1/academic-profiles/:id` - Update academic profile
- `DELETE /api/v1/academic-profiles/:id` - Delete academic profile
- `GET /api/v1/academic-profiles/:id/bagrut-subjects` - Get bagrut subjects
- `POST /api/v1/academic-profiles/:id/bagrut-subjects` - Add bagrut subject

### Next After Academic Profiles:
1. **Program Matches API** - Handle recommendation storage and retrieval
2. **Matching Algorithm Implementation** - Core recommendation engine
3. **Frontend React Components** - User interface implementation
